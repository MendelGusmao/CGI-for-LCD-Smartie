PHP FOR LCD SMARTIE

    This document describes the basic concept and usage of PHP for LCD Smartie.

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
    For now, there is no plugin done. I'm deciding if it will be done on Visual Basic
    or C++. As a PHP programmer, I'm a little bit rusty with VB6 (about 4 years without
    doing something), and I never used to develop complex things in C++. So, have patience!

    The plugin acts as a gateway between LCD Smartie and PHP. Every time it's
    called, it executes the PHP interpreter and returns the data to LCD Smartie
    to show on display. Optionally you can call a function wrote in a script instead
    of executing the entire file. This feature helps you to keep your codes organized
    in just one place.

<<<<<<< HEAD
    It's made in Visual Basic 6.0 but I'm planning to port it to C++ when my knowledge allow.

CONFIGURING

=======
>>>>>>> 07cff39be2603d1af10bf80a6d8b9061e68388cd
    The first step of configuration is to copy the directory called "scripts" to LCD Smartie
    directory. Inside are two files, main.php and test.php. The first is the most important,
    because it contains the code necessary to parse the incoming data from $dll and
    perform what it was asked to do. The second is a testfile with some silly functions to
    test if everything's OK.

    The second step is to configure, setting the PHP interpreter (usually php.exe)
    and the timeout in config.ini, adding this entry:

<<<<<<< HEAD
        [PHP]
        interpreter="c:\php\bin\php.exe"
=======
        [php]
        cli="c:\php\bin\php.exe"
>>>>>>> 07cff39be2603d1af10bf80a6d8b9061e68388cd
        timeout=5

    Of course, replace the path above by the path of the PHP interpreter on your machine.

USING
=======
    Due to a bug (it's not a bug, it's a feature!) of LCD Smartie, the program awaits
    for the end of the execution of the plugin code before showing any data on the display.
    If a programming error or something else causes freezing of the PHP interpreter,
    the plugin will freeze, waiting for PHP process to terminate and then, LCD Smartie will
    be freezing too. If the PHP process take more time than the chosen value of timeout, it
    will be instantly killed and the plugin will return an empty string.

    The $dll parameters are 2:

        - filename (mandatory)
        - function (optional) and arguments, also optional

        > $dll(php,1,filename[.php],[function[#arg1;arg2;...]])

<<<<<<< HEAD
    - For now, there's just one internal plugin function.
      * Maybe I add one more to show PHP's version by getting
        the output of "php.exe -v".
    - The extension in filename is optional.

    Until it's not done, there are three possible usages for the plugin in LCD Smartie

        1 - Executing a PHP file
=======
    - The internal plugin function will be always 1.
    - The extension in filename is optional.

    There are three possible usages for the plugin in LCD Smartie

        1 - Executing a PHP file entirely

            Just tell the PHP interpreter to execute an entire file
>>>>>>> 07cff39be2603d1af10bf80a6d8b9061e68388cd

            $dll(php,1,file[.php],)

        2 - Executing a function of a PHP file without arguments

            $dll(php,1,file[.php],function)

        3 - Executing a function of a PHP file with arguments

            $dll(php,1,file[.php],function#arg1;arg2;argX)

    The first usage doesn't require your script to include "main.php" but the others do,
<<<<<<< HEAD
    because it needs parsing of the parameters to know what will be evaluated and what
    parameters will be used to do that.

WRITING SCRIPTS

    Create a .php file in scripts directory with the following lines

    <?php

        include 'main.php';

	// your code here

	main();

    ?>

ISSUES

    Due to a bug (it's not a bug, it's a feature!) of LCD Smartie, the program awaits
    for the end of the execution of the plugin code before showing any data on the display.
    If a programming error, race condition, infinite loop or something else causes freezing
    of the PHP interpreter, the plugin will freeze, waiting for PHP process to terminate and
    then, LCD Smartie will be freezing too. My plan is to implement a watchdog timer, then, in
    case the PHP process take more time than the chosen value of timeout, it will be instantly
    killed and the plugin will return an empty string.

    I'm not sure if it's a problem of PHP interpreter, of the plugin or LCD Smartie,
    but when using the plugin, the LCD Smartie goes slow. For a test with a script
    that contains 4 functions (monitoring of some bot applications), it was really slow and
    sometimes the screen appeared for just 1 second before the next screen.
